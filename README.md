# Book Reservation System

This project is an integrative Book Reservation System built with Django. It demonstrates how multiple scripting and coding languages can be used together to create a functional program.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for backend development with Django, including lists, functions, arrays, and dictionaries.
- **HTML/CSS**: Utilizes Bootstrap for styling and customizations to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **PostgreSQL**: Designed and managed the database to store book and user information.
- **Django**: Web framework used to handle HTTP requests, manage database interactions, and render templates.

## Project Structure

### Root Directory

- **bookreservation/**: Main Django project directory.
  - **settings.py**: Contains configurations, including database settings for PostgreSQL.
  - **urls.py**: Defines URL routes for the project.
  - **wsgi.py** and **asgi.py**: Configuration for web servers.

- **reservation/**: Application for managing book reservations.
  - **admin.py**: Configures the admin interface.
  - **models.py**: Defines database models for books and reservations.
  - **views.py**: Handles HTTP requests and business logic.
